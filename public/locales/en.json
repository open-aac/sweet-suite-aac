  "dwell_1": "For communicators without consistent motor control, eye trackers can sometimes be an effective access method. An eye tracker is a special camera that tracks eye movements. When a communicator's gaze lingers on a button for a period of time, the system can select that button on behalf of the communicator. Alternatively, some systems can track hear or body movement using cameras or sensors to treat the mouse cursor like a joystick, and when the cursor \"dwells\" over a button, it is selected. Eye or dwell tracking can be faster than switch access, but is more difficult to calibrate correctly.",
  "dwell_2": "%app_name% can work with any eye tracker or system that supports cursor control (we have tested Tobii, MyGaze, eyetech and LC Technologies, and EagleEyes hardware).
