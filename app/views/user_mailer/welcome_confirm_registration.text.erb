Hello and thanks for signing up for <%= app_name %>!

I wanted to reach out to you to see how things are going. I know getting to know a new AAC language system can be a challenge. If you have questions, feel free to contact me at any time - I'd be glad to help.

This support article shares helpful information as you begin using <%= app_name %> and AAC: https://coughdrop.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/ 201366579-How-do-I-start- using-CoughDrop-for-AAC-.
