Thank you for purchasing a supporter account for <%= app_name %>, <b><%= @user.user_name %></b>! 
We're excited for you to be use this account to support communicators as they use
<%= app_name %> to express themselves, learn, and interact with the world around them!
<%= app_name %> was
built to provide a simple and flexible interface for communicators, and a powerful set of tools
to help the support team as they work with those communicators. We hope this app
makes a difference for everyone who uses it, including you!<br/><br/>

If you haven't already, make sure to have the communicators you work with add you
as a supervisor on their account. You will still be able to edit, create and share
boards on your own, but many features of <%= app_name %> are specifically targeted towards
supporting communicators that are linked to your account.<br/><br/>

<%= app_name %> has a lot of great features that help not only the communicator, but the team
around them to stay informed and to work together toward communication goals. Just about
everything is configurable in <%= app_name %>, from eye tracking support, to switch access, to
button sizing, to picture display... there's a lot in here! But don't worry, you can
learn gradually as you go, and there are plenty of videos and walkthroughs available in
our <a href="<%= support_url %>">usage guides</a>.<br/><br/>

If you're unsure where to start, feel free to check out our 
<a href="<%= support_url %>"><%= app_name %> usage guides</a> for walkthroughs of 
common tasks, or to shoot us a message if you need help or think something might be broken.<br/><br/>

Thanks again for signing up for <%= app_name %>! We hope you enjoy using the tool, and please
don't hesitate to let us know if you think of anything we could do to make things easier.<br/><br/>

Thanks!<br/>
