    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>Updated: January 11, 2021</p>

    <p>ORGANIZATION_NAME (“APP_NAME,” “we” or “us”) values you and respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to your use of APP_NAME’s website located at <a href="https://www.myAPP_NAME.com">myAPP_NAME.com</a> (the “Site”) and APP_NAME’s product, including associated parts, components and software and whether accessed via an Internet browser, smartphone, tablet or other mobile device (the “Product”). This Privacy Policy describes the type of information we may collect from you or that you may provide to us when you visits the Site or uses the Product, how that information is used and the choices you have regarding the use of such information. Your use of the Site and/or the Product indicates your acceptance of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site or the Product. We invite you to contact us if you have questions about this Privacy Policy by one of the methods set forth under “Contact Us” below.</p>

    <p>For additional details on how we handle personal information please see our <a href="/privacy_practices">Respecting User Privacy resource at https://app.myAPP_NAME.com/privacy_practices</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Use of Personal Information Collected.</strong> APP_NAME may collect information about you that can be used to contact or uniquely identify you (“Personal Information”), only on a voluntary basis. Such Personal Information may include information such as your name, postal address, email address, telephone number and biographic data.</p>

    <p>We collect Personal Information from you if you request information from us, sign up to join our email lists, register an account with APP_NAME, or otherwise volunteer such information to APP_NAME. The Personal Information we collect is used to notify you of updates to our Site, other websites, products or services we offer, to respond to inquiries, to carry out our obligations and enforce our rights, and to fulfill any other purpose for which you provide your Personal Information to us. We retain your Personal Information as long as you remain an active user of the Site and/or Product and for a reasonable number of years thereafter, or until you request that we delete it.</p>

    <p>Your Personal Information, including, without limitation, your email address, will not be sold or provided to third parties except as set forth in this Privacy Policy. In the event we would like to use information collected from you in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will obtain your consent to do so.</p>

    <p><strong>Information Provided By a Child.</strong>  The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and its rules require us to inform parents and legal guardians about our practices for collecting, using and disclosing Personal Information from children under the age of 13. Children under the age of 13 may use the Site and/or the Product solely with the express consent of their parent or guardian.  If you permit your child to use the Site and/or Product, you hereby represent and warrant that you have consented to such use, and you hereby agree that you will be responsible in all respects for your child’s use of the Site and/or Product.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, under no circumstances may a child under the age of 13 submit or otherwise enter or make available any Personal Information about himself/herself (including, without limitation, through the use of open-text fields).  If you become aware that your child has submitted or made available Personal Information to us, please contact us through any of the methods described under “Contact Us” and we will promptly delete such Personal Information.</p>

    <p><strong>Health-Related Personal Information.</strong>  Please do not submit or store any information regarding your or anyone else’s health or medical status (pursuant to all applicable laws) using the Site or the Product.  If and to the extent you choose to do so, you understand and agree that (a) you and you alone bear the sole burden and responsibility of obtaining any consents or authorizations for disclosures of patient information that may be necessary under federal, state and local law; (b) any errors or inaccuracies in the information that you submit through the Site or Product are your responsibility and could result in deficiencies in your use of the Site or Product; and (c) APP_NAME takes no responsibility for, and makes no representations or warranties concerning, the accuracy of any information entered, disclosed or transmitted by you.</p>

    <p><strong>Other Information Collected Online.</strong> In some cases, APP_NAME may collect information about you that is not personally identifiable, including through automated means such as cookies. For example, APP_NAME may collect information such as domain type, browser version, service provider and IP address. Cookies enable us to track things in aggregate form such as the total number of visitors to the Site, and the length of the visits to the Site. Such information is stored in APP_NAME’s database. No Personal Information is extracted in this process. The information we collect using automated means is used for internal review to improve the Site, and is not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes.</p>

    <p><strong>Mobile Device Data.</strong> When users download, install and use the Product on their mobile phone or other wireless telecommunications device, APP_NAME automatically gathers information, including, without limitation, carrier providers, unique device identifiers, geo-location information (if allowed by the user), the types of mobile devices accessing the Product, and the types of operating systems accessing the Product (collectively, “Mobile Device Data”).  A unique device identifier is a string of alphanumeric characters (similar to a serial number) used to uniquely identify and distinguish each mobile phone or other wireless communications device. Location services can be enabled or disabled at any time, through the settings on your mobile device and/or in the Product. APP_NAME uses Mobile Device Data to understand usage patterns and to improve the Product.</p>

    <p><strong>Head and Eye Gaze Tracking.</strong> 
    When users download, install and use the Product on their mobile phone or other wireless telecommunications device, APP_NAME includes optional functionality to evaluate eye gaze, head position and facial expressions using multiple sensors including cameras (such as Apple's TrueDepth API). This tracking is used for alternative access methods to allow users to target and select on-screen options. Facial information is not tracked unless user logging is enabled, and then data is tracked only to the level that will allow differentiating selection techniques, and is not saved. Eye gaze, head position and facial expression tracking and logging can be enabled or disabled at any time, through the settings on your mobile device and/or in the Product. APP_NAME may use metadata about head and gaze tracking to understand usage patterns and to improve the Product.</p>

    <p><strong>Information We Share.</strong> We use third parties to help us provide services to users, such as fulfilling orders, processing payments, monitoring site activity, conducting surveys, maintaining our database, administering emails, and administering promotions. Third parties also provide us with aggregate, comparative information regarding the performance of our Site.</p>

    <p>You should be aware that we may disclose specific information about you if required to do so by law or based on our good faith belief that it is necessary to enforce or apply our Terms of Use, conform or comply with applicable law or is necessary to protect us, the users of our Site or others.</p>

    <p>We also reserve the right to transfer your Personal Information in the event we sell, merge or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale, merger or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use information you have provided to us in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. Following such a sale, merger or transfer, you may contact the entity to which we transferred your information with any inquiries concerning the processing of that information.</p>

    <p>Other than as set forth above, we will not share or sell your information to any outside organization without your consent.</p>

    <p><strong>Anonymous Research and Community Reports.</strong> APP_NAME regularly shares public reports with the online community to enourage additional research into AAC practices. Generalized usage data from users who have enabled logging and approved inclusion in aggregate reports will be included, only in an anonymized and aggregate manner, in these public reports, unless they have explicitly opted out. Additionally, we partner with research organizations to analyze AAC usage on a more detailed, but still anonymized level, and users may opt-in to allowing their anonymized, non-aggregated usage data to be shared externally for potentially public research purposes.</p>

    <p><strong>Your Choices.</strong> If you do not wish for us to use your Personal Information to send you promotions regarding our products or services, you can opt out of such use by checking the relevant box located on the form on which we collect your Personal Information or at any other time by sending an email to <a href="mailto:support@APP_NAME.com">support@APP_NAME.com</a> stating your request. If we have sent you a promotional email, you may choose not to receive further promotional emails from us by clicking on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of such email.</p>

    <p>Most browsers allow you to stop accepting new cookies, or to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and have the ability for you to disable existing cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of all of our Site’s features.</p>
