    <p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY.</p>

    <p>This TERMS OF USE AND LICENSE AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you (either an individual or an entity) and ORGANIZATION_NAME. (“APP_NAME”, “we” or “us”).  This Agreement applies to and governs your use of and access to APP_NAME’s website located at <a href="https://www.myAPP_NAME.com" target="_blank">myAPP_NAME.com</a> (the “Site”) and  the APP_NAME or APP_NAME Pro products, including associated parts, components and software and whether accessed via an Internet browser, smartphone, tablet, or other mobile devices (the “Product”).  The APP_NAME Privacy Policy (available at <a href="https://app.myAPP_NAME.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://app.myAPP_NAME.com/privacy</a>) is incorporated herein by reference and governs your access to and use of the Site and the Product.</p>

    <p>BY ACCESSING THE SITE AND/OR DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, ACCESSING OR USING THE PRODUCT IN ANY MANNER, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT ACCESS THE SITE OR DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, ACCESS OR USE THE PRODUCT.</p>
    <p>Your use of certain pages, content or services within the Site or the Product may be subject to additional terms and conditions. Before being given access to such pages, content or services, you will be asked to indicate whether you agree to be bound by the additional terms and conditions. If you do not agree to be bound by such additional terms and conditions, you may not access or use such pages, content or services.</p>
    <p><strong>Modification of the Agreement.</strong> In its sole discretion, ORGANIZATION_NAME reserves the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions of the Site or the Product, or to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Agreement at any time by making such modified Agreement available to you. The Agreement will be identified as of the most recent date of revision at the beginning of this Agreement and will be effective immediately upon being made available to you, except in the event any such modification materially alters your rights hereunder, we will attempt to notify you directly by sending a message to the email address that you provided to us. Your use of the Site or the Product after modifications to the Agreement become effective constitutes your binding acceptance of such changes. In such case of a material modification, you will be required to agree to such modified Agreement affirmatively. If you are dissatisfied with the terms of the Agreement or any modifications thereof, then you agree that your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue any use of the Site and/or Product.</p>

    <p><strong>Registration.</strong> You must register with us to subscribe to use of the Product. As part of the registration process, you will be asked to select a password and a valid and verifiable email address. You must provide us with accurate, complete, and updated registration information. Failure to do so will constitute a breach of this Agreement. You understand that you may not: (a) impersonate another person; (b) use the username or password of any person other than yourself without authorization; or (c) use a username that we, in our sole discretion, deem offensive.</p>

    <p>You must treat your username and/or password as confidential, and you must not disclose it to any third party. You are responsible for all activities on the Site or in connection with the Product that occur under your username or password, if any. You agree to immediately notify ORGANIZATION_NAME of any unauthorized use of your username or password or any other breach of security.</p>

    <p><strong>Availability; Changes.</strong> We employ reasonable measures to try to provide you with access to the Site and Product 24/7. However, there will be occasions when the Site and/or the Product will be interrupted for maintenance, upgrades for emergency repairs, or due to the failure of telecommunications links or equipment or other circumstances that are beyond our control. We will take reasonable steps, when possible, to minimize such disruption. From time to time, and without notice to you, ORGANIZATION_NAME may add or delete certain features or functions from the Site and/or the Product. ORGANIZATION_NAME reserves the right to suspend or discontinue (temporarily or permanently), the Site, the Product, or any portion thereof.  You agree that ORGANIZATION_NAME shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the Site, Product, or any features or functions thereof.</p>

    <p><strong>Limited License.</strong> Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,  ORGANIZATION_NAME hereby grants you during the term of this Agreement a worldwide, limited, revocable, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, non-exclusive license to access and use the Site and download, install, access, and/or use the Product on an Internet browser or device (mobile or otherwise) controlled or owned by you (the “Licensee”).</p>

    <p><strong>Prohibited Commercial Use.</strong> The Product is licensed for personal and educational use only and may not be used for commercial purposes. You may not use the Product to provide services to third parties or incorporate the Product into any service that you provide to third parties. Any attempt to resell, lease, or offer the Product for commercial gain is strictly prohibited.</p>

    <p><strong>Payment Terms.</strong>  Your subscription to the Product is renewed automatically for the same term selected upon initial payment (for month-to-month and annual subscriptions).  You may change your subscription term at any time by contacting us (see “Contact Us” below).  Your credit card will be charged once a month for monthly subscriptions and once a year (upon the anniversary of your subscription date) for annual subscriptions. Multi-year subscriptions will not be auto renewed and an additional purchase is required to continue using the product at the end of the term. ORGANIZATION_NAME will email you a receipt when your card has been charged. If your card cannot be charged, your access to the Product may be suspended and you will need to update your card information to resume use. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgraded or downgraded accounts, or for months unused with an open account.  All fees are exclusive of all taxes or duties imposed by governing authorities. You alone are responsible for the payment of all such taxes or duties.</p>

    <p>Yearly subscription pricing requires a one-year minimum commitment. If you cancel your subscription, or your subscription is suspended for nonpayment, before the end of the one-year commitment period, you will no longer qualify for yearly subscription pricing and you will be charged the difference between the monthly and yearly commitment pricing for the number of months your subscription was active.</p>

    <p>At any time APP_NAME may change the price of your subscription or any part thereof, or institute new charges or fees. Price changes and the institution of new charges implemented during your one-year subscription period will come into effect for any subsequent one-year subscription periods and to all new subscribers after the effective date of the change. If you do not agree to any such price changes, then you must cancel your subscription and stop using the Product before the commencement of the renewal subscription period to which the price change applies.</p>

The APP_NAME Materials, including all associated intellectual property rights, are protected by copyright, trade dress, patent, and trademark laws of the United States and other jurisdictions, international conventions, and all other relevant intellectual property and proprietary rights and applicable laws. All right, title, and interest in and to the APP_NAME Materials, including intellectual property rights therein and thereto, are the exclusive property of APP_NAME, its subsidiaries, affiliated companies, and/or third-party licensors.
